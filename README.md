# Things

Introducing the revolutionary new to-do app that’s going to totally change your life! Because, of course, what you really needed was yet another app to remind you of all the tasks you’ll probably ignore anyway. Things does everything your phone's default notes app already does—but with more steps! Add tasks, forget them, and experience the joy of feeling productive without actually doing anything. Perfect for those who love the idea of organization but are completely allergic to follow-through.
